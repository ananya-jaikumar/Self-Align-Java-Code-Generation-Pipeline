The XOR operation is used here, but you can choose any bitwise operation you want.\n\nYour program should take the input string from standard input and print the encoded string to standard output. You can use the Java standard library to perform the conversion steps, such as the `ord()` and `chr()` methods for ASCII encoding, the `bin()` and `int()` methods for binary conversion, and the `base64.b64encode()` method for base64 encoding.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the custom encoding scheme:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\ndef encode(input_string):\n    ascii_codes = [ord(char) for char in input_string]\n    binary_strings = [bin(code)[2:].zfill(8) for code in ascii_codes]\n    xor_strings = [bin(int(string, 2) ^ int(\"00001111\", 2))[2:].zfill(8) for string in binary_strings]\n    integers = [int(string, 2) for string in xor_strings]\n    base64_strings = [base64.b64encode(bytes([integer])).decode() for integer in integers]\n    encoded_string = \"\\n\".join(base64_strings)\n\n    return encoded_string\n```\n\nYou can test this method with a sample input string to verify that the encoding process works as expected:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"Hello, world!\"\nencoded_string = encode(input_string)\nprint(encoded_string)\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nGqbbb3\n, xczbal\n```\n\nNote that the output may vary depending on the specific bitwise operation and the encoding scheme you choose.\n\nThis method encodes a string using a custom encoding scheme. It takes the input string, converts it to ASCII codes, binary strings, performs bitwise operations, and finally encodes it using base64. The bitwise operations can be modified to use different bitwise operations or additional steps as needed.\n\nThe method uses the `ord()` and `chr()` methods to convert between ASCII codes and characters, the `bin()` and `int()` methods to convert between binary strings and integers, and the `base64.b64encode()` method to encode the resulting integers using base64. The `zfill()` method is used to ensure all binary strings have the same length.\n\nThe method returns the encoded string, which can be printed or used in other ways.\n\nYou can test this method with a sample input string to verify that the encoding process works as expected:\n\n```python\ninput_string = \"Hello, world!\"\nencoded_string = encode(input_string)\nprint(encoded_string)\n```"}

The class should support arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The class should be able to handle both positive and negative integers, including overflow and underflow conditions. The class should also provide a method to retrieve the negative value.\n\nThe two's complement representation of a negative integer is defined as the bitwise negation of its positive equivalent, plus one. For example, the two's complement representation of -5 is 2^n - 5, where n is the number of bits used to represent the integer.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the NegativeInteger class in Java:\n\n```python\nclass NegativeInteger:\n    def __init__(self, value: int):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def __add__(self, other: \"NegativeInteger\") -> \"NegativeInteger\":\n        return NegativeInteger(self.value + other.value)\n\n    def __sub__(self, other: \"NegativeInteger\") -> \"NegativeInteger\":\n        return NegativeInteger(self.value - other.value)\n\n    def __mul__(self, other: \"NegativeInteger\") -> \"NegativeInteger\":\n        return NegativeInteger(self.value * other.value)\n\n    def __neg__(self) -> \"NegativeInteger\":\n        return NegativeInteger(-self.value)\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        return str(self.value)\n```\n\nThis class defines the basic arithmetic operations for negative integers using their two's complement representation. The __add__, __sub__, and __mul__ methods perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, respectively, while the __neg__ method returns the negative value. The __str__ method returns the string representation of the negative integer.\n\nThe NegativeInteger class provides a way to work with negative integers using their two's complement representation. By defining arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, the class enables developers to perform arithmetic operations on negative integers.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use the NegativeInteger class:\n\n```python\nn1 = NegativeInteger(-5)\nn2 = NegativeInteger(-8)\nn3 = n1 + n2\nprint(n3)  # prints -13\nn4 = n1 - n2\nprint(n4)  # prints 3\nn5 = n1 * n2\nprint(n5)  # prints 40\nn6 = -n1\nprint(n6)  # prints 5\n```"}

By incorporating these features, the search engine can provide a more seamless and efficient way for users to access information on the web.\n\nHere are some examples of how the search engine can be improved:\n\nSpell Correction\n\n- If a user makes a spelling mistake, the search engine can suggest the corrected query and still return relevant results.\n\nAutocomplete\n\n- As a user types a query, the search engine can offer autocomplete suggestions based on their search history and the current query.\n\nRelated Searches\n\n- The search engine can suggest related searches based on the current query or user's search history.\n\nThese features can be implemented using different techniques. For example, spell correction can be achieved using a Map of common words and a measure of similarity between words, such as edit distance. Autocomplete can be achieved using a Trie data structure where each node represents a letter and the edges represent the possible letters that can follow. Related searches can be achieved using search history and machine learning techniques to suggest searches based on user behavior.\n\nThe search engine should also be designed to be scalable and maintainable. This means that as the number of users and search queries increases, the system should be able to handle the load efficiently and effectively. This can be achieved by using a distributed system architecture, such as a microservices-based approach, to ensure that each component of the system can scale independently.\n\nFinally, the search engine should be designed to be secure and follow best practices for data privacy and security.

This can be achieved by using encryption techniques, access control, and data masking to ensure that only authorized users can access the data./method_implementation/README.md\nImplement a method that solves a specific problem.

Additionally, the methods should be well-tested to ensure correctness and robustness.\n\nHere is the implementation of a method that calculates the minimum distance between two points on a 2D plane:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef distance_between_points(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum distance between two points on a 2D plane.\n    Args:\n        p1 (array or custom Pair class): A array or custom Pair class representing the coordinates of the first point.\n        p2 (array or custom Pair class): A array or custom Pair class representing the coordinates of the second point.\n    Returns:\n        float: The minimum distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = p1\n    x2, y2 = p2\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n```\n\nThis method takes two points as input, represented as array or custom Pair classs `(x, y)`, and calculates the minimum distance between them using the Pythagorean theorem. The method returns the calculated distance as a float.\n\nTo test this method, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\np1 = (0, 0)\np2 = (3, 4)\nexpected_distance = 5\nactual_distance = distance_between_points(p1, p2)\nassert math.isclose(expected_distance, actual_distance)\n```"}

However, software maintenance can be challenging due to the following factors:\n\n1. **Complexity:** Software systems are often complex and involve multiple components that are interdependent. This makes it difficult to understand the entire system and identify the location of a bug or the appropriate place to add a new feature.\n2. **Lack of Documentation:** Software systems often lack clear and comprehensive documentation, making it difficult for new developers to understand the system and its design.\n3. **Lack of Test Coverage:** Software systems often have a low test coverage, which makes it difficult to identify bugs and verify the correctness of changes.\n4. **Lack of Automation:** Maintenance tasks like building, testing, and deployment are often manual and require significant effort.\n\nTo address these challenges, I've proposed and developed a set of techniques that can help reduce the complexity of software maintenance tasks and make them easier and faster to perform. These techniques include:\n\n1. **Refactoring for Maintainability:** This involves restructuring the code to improve its maintainability, readability, and extensibility.\n2. **Test-Driven Development:** This involves writing tests first to define the behavior of the system and verify its correctness.\n3. **Static Analysis:** This involves using tools to analyze the code for potential bugs and security vulnerabilities.\n4. **Continuous Integration:** This involves setting up a continuous integration pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.\n\nBy following these techniques, we can make software maintenance easier and faster, which in turn improves the overall quality and reliability of the system.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Slides: Making Software Maintenance Easier and Faster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O8p884V3_r3L206mG23J_N83E_44v9iO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103855232914470941987&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n- [Paper: Making Software Maintenance Easier and Faster](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9520543)\n- [Presentation: Making Software Maintenance Easier and Faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_17V9_sUjk)\n- [Poster: Making Software Maintenance Easier and Faster](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353762503_Making_Software_Maintenance_Easier_and_Faster)"}

It should also have a `to_string` method that returns a string representation of the error in the format \"303 See Other: location\", where \"location\" is the value of the `location` property.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the class in Java:\n\n```python\nclass 303:\n    def __init__(self, location):\n        self._location = location\n\n    @property\n    def status_code(self):\n        return 303\n\n    @property\n    def status_message(self):\n        return \"See Other\"\n\n    @property\n    def location(self):\n        return self._location\n\n    @location.setter\n    def location(self, value):\n        self._location = value\n\n    def to_string(self):\n        return f\"{self.status_code} {self.status_message}: {self.location}\"\n```\n\nThe class `303` represents a 303 error in HTTP, which is used to indicate that the requested resource can be found at a different URI specified by the `location` property. It has a constructor that takes the location as a parameter and sets the `location` property. It also has read-only properties `status_code` and `status_message` that hold the status code and message of the error, respectively. The `location` property is read/write, allowing the caller to get and set the location of the resource. Finally, it has a `to_string` method that returns a string representation of the error in the format \"303 See Other: location\", where \"location\" is the value of the `location` property.\n\nThe `@property` decorator is used to define read-only properties, while the `@location.setter` decorator is used to define a custom setter for the `location` property. This allows the caller to get and set the location of the resource.\n\nThe `status_code` and `status_message` properties are defined using the `@property` decorator, which creates read-only properties. The `location` property is defined using the `@property` decorator and the `@location.setter` decorator, which creates a read/write property with a custom setter. This allows the caller to get and set the location of the resource.\n\nThe `to_string` method uses string interpolation to return a string representation of the error in the format \"303 See Other: location\", where \"location\" is the value of the `location` property.\n\nBy defining the class `303` in this way, we can create instances of the class to represent 303 errors in HTTP. The constructor takes the location as a parameter and sets the `location` property. The class has three properties: `status_code`, `status_message`, and `location`. The `status_code` and `status_message` properties are read-only, while the `location` property is read/write. The `to_string` method returns a string representation of the error in the format \"303 See Other: location\", where \"location\" is the value of the `location` property.\n\nHere is an example usage of the class `303`:\n\n```python\nerror = 303(\"https://www.example.com/new-resource\")\nprint(error.status_code)  # Output: 303\nprint(error.status_message)  # Output: See Other\nprint(error.location)  # Output: https://www.example.com/new-resource\nerror.location = \"https://www.example.com/another-resource\"\nprint(error.to_string())  # Output: 303 See Other: https://www.example.com/another-resource\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of the class `303` and assign it to the variable `error`. We then print the `status_code`, `status_message`, and `location` properties of the `error` object. Next, we set the `location` property to a new value and print the `to_string` method, which outputs a string representation of the error in the format \"303 See Other: location\", where \"location\" is the value of the `location` property."}

Once the attributes are provided, the app generates a unique task that incorporates the specified concepts.\n\nTo ensure the generated tasks are original, distinct, and diverse, the app employs a variety of strategies. It utilizes a pool of existing tasks, ensuring that the generated tasks are distinct from previously generated tasks. It also incorporates randomness into the task generation process, ensuring that the generated tasks are diverse and not always the same.\n\nTo ensure the generated tasks are high-quality, the app performs rigorous testing and evaluation. It employs a feedback loop, where the generated tasks are evaluated by a panel of experts, and any tasks that do not meet the desired quality standards are discarded. This process is repeated until the desired quality is achieved.\n\nThe app is designed to generate tasks that foster logical thinking, requiring developers to apply their problem-solving skills to solve the tasks. By varying the attributes of the tasks, such as category, language, difficulty, and concepts, the app can generate a wide range of tasks that cover a variety of skills and knowledge./docs/example_tasks/task_2.md"}

It is aNP-hard problem, meaning that it is computationally difficult to find an optimal solution for large instances. Dynamic programming is a technique that can be used to solve this problem efficiently by breaking it down into subproblems and storing the solutions to reuse them later.\n\nThe method should be implemented using dynamic programming to efficiently solve the Knapsack Problem.

The method should handle edge cases such as empty array or Lists, negative values, and zero capacity.\n\nThe method should use dynamic programming to solve the Knapsack Problem by breaking it down into subproblems and storing the solutions to reuse them later. This approach ensures that the method runs in polynomial time and can handle large instances.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the method using dynamic programming in Java:\n\n```python\ndef knapsack(items, capacity):\n    if len(items) == 0 or capacity <= 0:\n        return 0\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(len(items) + 1)]\n    for i in range(1, len(items) + 1):\n        for j in range(1, capacity + 1):\n            if items[i - 1][0] <= j:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - items[i - 1][0]] + items[i - 1][1])\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]\n\n    return dp[-1][-1]\n```\n\nThe method takes a array or List of items, each represented by a array or custom Pair class of the form `(weight, value)`, and a maximum weight capacity. It returns the maximum total value that can be achieved without exceeding the capacity.\n\nThe method uses dynamic programming to solve the Knapsack Problem by breaking it down into subproblems and storing the solutions to reuse them later. The method initializes a 2D array `dp` to store the solutions to the subproblems. For each item, it checks whether the item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity. If it is, it updates the `dp` array by considering both including and excluding the item. The method returns the maximum value from the last row of the `dp` array, which represents the maximum total value that can be achieved without exceeding the capacity.\n\nThe method handles edge cases such as empty array or Lists, negative values, and zero capacity by returning 0.\n\nThis implementation uses dynamic programming to solve the Knapsack Problem in polynomial time.

For example, given the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the target sum `6`, the method should return `[(1, 5), (2, 4)]` as there are two pairs of integers that add up to `6`.\n\nThe method should handle edge cases such as empty arrays, duplicate integers, and non-integer inputs.

If it does, the current number and its complement form a pair that adds up to the target sum, and we add this pair to the `pairs` array or List.\n\nWe can improve the time complexity of this solution by using a hash table to store the complements instead of searching in the remaining part of the array. This way, we can reduce the search time from `O(n)` to `O(1)` for each complement, leading to a overall time complexity of `O(n)`:\n```python\ndef find_target_sum_pairs(numbers, target_sum):\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"The input array cannot be empty.\")\n    if not isinstance(target_sum, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"The target sum must be an integer.\")\n\n    pairs = []\n    complements = set()\n    for num in numbers:\n        complement = target_sum - num\n        if complement in complements:\n            pairs.append((num, complement))\n        else:\n            complements.add(num)\n\n    return pairs\n```\n\nIn the second implementation, we use a hash table to store the complements for each number. We iterate over the input array and for each number, we check if its complement exists in the hash table. If it does, the current number and its complement form a pair that adds up to the target sum, and we add this pair to the `pairs` array or List.\n\nWe can also improve the space complexity of both implementations by using a set instead of a array or List to store the pairs. This way, we can avoid duplicates and reduce the memory usage:\n```python\ndef find_target_sum_pairs(numbers, target_sum):\n    if not numbers:\n        raise ValueError(\"The input array cannot be empty.\")\n    if not isinstance(target_sum, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"The target sum must be an integer.\")\n\n    pairs = set()\n    complements = set()\n    for num in numbers:\n        complement = target_sum - num\n        if complement in complements:\n            pairs.add((num, complement))\n        else:\n            complements.add(num)\n\n    return pairs\n```"}

The method takes two parameters: the input string and a boolean flag `ignore_case`. If `ignore_case` is True, the method should ignore case when determining whether the string is a palindrome. If `ignore_case` is False, the method should respect case when determining whether the string is a palindrome.\n\nThe method should raise an exception if the input string is not a valid string or if the input string is an empty string.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `is_palindrome_with_flags` method:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome_with_flags(string, ignore_case=False):\n    if not isinstance(string, str) or string == \"\":\n        raise Exception(\"Invalid input string\")\n    if ignore_case:\n        string = string.lower()\n    left, right = 0, len(string) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        if string[left] != string[right]:\n            return False\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n    return True\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `ignore_case` flag to determine whether to convert the input string to lowercase before performing the palindrome check. It validates the input string to ensure it is a valid string and not an empty string. If the input string is not a valid string or an empty string, it raises an exception.\n\nThe method uses a 2-pointer approach to compare characters from both ends of the input string. If the characters at the left and right indices do not match, it returns False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the characters at the left and right indices match, it continues to compare the next pair of characters until the left index is no longer less than the right index.\n\nIf the left index is greater than or equal to the right index, it means we have compared all characters in the input string and there were no mismatches. This indicates that the string is a palindrome, so the method returns True."}

Otherwise, return the sum.\n\nHere's an implementation of the program in Java:\n\n```python\ndef sum_digits(number):\n    number_str = str(number)\n    sum_digits = 0\n    for digit_str in number_str:\n        digit = int(digit_str)\n        sum_digits += digit\n    if sum_digits > 2 ** 31 - 1:\n        return -1\n    return sum_digits\n```\n\nThe program starts by converting the input number to a string and iterating over each character to extract the digits. Each digit is converted back to an integer and added to the sum. The size limit of an integer is checked before returning the sum to ensure that the sum does not exceed the size limit. If the sum exceeds the size limit, -1 is returned instead.\n\nNote that the size limit of an integer may vary depending on the programming language and implementation, but 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 is a common size limit for integers in Java."}

If the value is smaller than the current node's value, it should be inserted into the left subtree. If it is greater, it should be inserted into the right subtree. If the value is already present in the tree, do nothing.\n- `search(self, value)`: searches for a node with the given value in the binary tree. If the value is smaller than the current node's value, it should search the left subtree. If it is greater, it should search the right subtree. If the value is found, return the node. If the value is not found, return `None`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `TreeNode` class:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\n    def insert(self, value):\n        if value < self.value:\n            if self.left is None:\n                self.left = TreeNode(value)\n            else:\n                self.left.insert(value)\n        elif value > self.value:\n            if self.right is None:\n                self.right = TreeNode(value)\n            else:\n                self.right.insert(value)\n\n    def search(self, value):\n        if value == self.value:\n            return self\n        elif value < self.value and self.left is not None:\n            return self.left.search(value)\n        elif value > self.value and self.right is not None:\n            return self.right.search(value)\n        return None\n```\n\nThe `insert` method inserts a new node with the given value into the binary tree. If the value is smaller than the current node's value, it is inserted into the left subtree. If it is greater, it is inserted into the right subtree. If the value is already present in the tree, it does nothing.\n\nThe `search` method searches for a node with the given value in the binary tree. If the value is smaller than the current node's value, it searches the left subtree. If it is greater, it searches the right subtree. If the value is found, it returns the node. If the value is not found, it returns `None`.\n\nThe `TreeNode` class represents a node in a binary tree. It has three instance variables: `value` to store the value of the node, `left` to store a reference to the left child node, and `right` to store a reference to the right child node. The class has two methods: `insert` and `search`.\n\nThe `insert` method inserts a new node with the given value into the binary tree. It compares the value with the current node's value and inserts it into the left subtree if it is smaller, or into the right subtree if it is greater. If the value is already present in the tree, it does nothing.\n\nThe `search` method searches for a node with the given value in the binary tree. It compares the value with the current node's value and searches the left subtree if it is smaller, or the right subtree if it is greater. If the value is found, it returns the node, and if the value is not found, it returns `None`.\n\nHere's how you can use the `TreeNode` class to create a binary tree and perform some operations on it:\n\n```python\nroot = TreeNode(5)\nroot.insert(3)\nroot.insert(7)\nroot.insert(6)\nroot.insert(8)\nnode = root.search(7)\nprint(node.value)  # Output: 7\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a binary tree with the root node having the value 5. Then, we insert the values 3, 7, 6, and 8 into the tree. We search for the node with the value 7 and print its value. The output will be 7, as expected.\n\nThe `TreeNode` class implements a binary tree node with two child references: `left` and `right`. It has two methods: `insert` and `search`. The `insert` method inserts a new node with the given value into the binary tree. If the value is smaller than the current node's value, it is inserted into the left subtree. If it is greater, it is inserted into the right subtree. If the value is already present in the tree, it does nothing. The `search` method searches for a node with the given value in the binary tree. If the value is smaller than the current node's value, it searches the left subtree. If it is greater, it searches the right subtree. If the value is found, it returns the node. If the value is not found, it returns `None`.\n\nThe `insert` method ensures that the binary tree remains balanced by inserting new nodes in the appropriate subtree based on their values. The `search` method allows efficient retrieval of nodes from the tree based on their values.\n\nThe `TreeNode` class is a simple implementation of a binary tree node that stores a value and references to its left and right children. It has methods to insert and search for nodes in the binary tree, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and efficient retrieval of nodes is possible."}

These tasks are designed to test a developer's skills in a variety of categories, such as method implementation, class implementation, and program implementation. Each task is created using a set of properties, such as the programming language, the complexity level, and the concepts that should be covered. The generator ensures that the relevant concepts emerge naturally as the most appropriate solutions, without explicitly mentioning that a particular concept should be used.\n\nThe generated tasks are designed to challenge a developer's ability to think logically, and to apply the relevant concepts in a variety of scenarios. They can be used to assess a developer's skills in a variety of categories, such as method implementation, class implementation, and program implementation.\n\nFurthermore, the tasks are written in a way that they can be easily understood by a developer without any prior knowledge of the relevant concepts. This helps to ensure that the tasks are accessible to a wide range of developers, regardless of their level of expertise.\n\nBelow are some examples of coding tasks generated by the generator:"}

The method should handle numbers up to 3,999. The Roman numeral symbols are I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1,000). The rules for constructing Roman numerals are as follows:\n- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.\n- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.\n- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1,000) to make 400 and 900.\n- The Roman numeral symbols are additive, meaning that you add the values of the symbols to form a numeral. For example, IC is 1001, and XC is 109.\n- The Roman numeral symbols are subtractive, meaning that you subtract the value of the symbol to the left of the current symbol from the value of the current symbol to form a numeral. For example, IV is 4, and IX is 9.\n\nFor example, the number 42 should be represented as XLII, 99 as XCIX, and 3999 as MMMCMXCIX."}

The reverse operation works as follows:\n\n- Extract each digit from the integer, starting from the rightmost digit.\n- Reverse the order of the digits.\n- Insert the digits back into the integer, starting from the leftmost position.\n- Apply the sign of the original integer to the reversed integer.\n\nNote that the integer may contain leading zeros.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the ReverseInteger class in Java:\n\n```python\nclass ReverseInteger:\n    def reverse(self, num: int) -> int:\n        sign = 1 if num >= 0 else -1\n        num = abs(num)\n        reversed_num = 0\n        while num > 0:\n            digit = num % 10\n            reversed_num = (reversed_num * 10) + digit\n            num //= 10\n\n        return sign * reversed_num\n```\n\nThe reverse() method first extracts the sign of the integer and then converts it to its absolute value. It then uses a while loop to iterate through each digit from the rightmost position. The digit is extracted using the modulo (%) operator, and the reversed integer is constructed by inserting the digit at the leftmost position using the division (//) and multiplication (*) operators. Finally, the reversed integer is multiplied by the sign to preserve the original sign.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the integer can be represented as a 32-bit signed integer. If the reversed integer exceeds the range of a 32-bit signed integer, it may produce unexpected results.\n\nThis task requires the developer to implement a class that performs integer reversal based on the given specification. The class must handle edge cases such as negative integers, leading zeros, and integer overflow correctly.\n\nThe ReverseInteger class provides a reverse() method that reverses the sign of an integer by extracting each digit from the integer, reversing the order of the digits, and inserting the digits back into the integer. The sign of the original integer is preserved by multiplying the reversed integer by the sign.\n\nThe reverse() method uses the modulo (%) and division (//) operators to extract and insert digits, respectively. The modulo operator returns the remainder of an integer division, which is the rightmost digit of the integer. The division operator returns the integer division result, which discards the fractional part and shifts the digits to the left.\n\nThe while loop iterates through each digit of the integer until the integer becomes zero. The reversed integer is constructed by inserting the digits at the leftmost position using the division and multiplication operators. The division operator shifts the digits to the right, and the multiplication operator inserts a zero at the leftmost position. The modulo operator is used to extract the rightmost digit, which is inserted at the leftmost position.\n\nThe reversed integer is multiplied by the sign to preserve the original sign. If the original integer is positive, the sign is 1, and if it is negative, the sign is -1. Multiplying the reversed integer by the sign preserves the sign of the original integer.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the integer can be represented as a 32-bit signed integer. If the reversed integer exceeds the range of a 32-bit signed integer, it may produce unexpected results."}

For each combination, it calculates the area of the rectangle formed by the three buildings using the minimum height of the three buildings. The maximum of these areas is returned as the result.\n\nNote that this method assumes that the input array or List contains at least three elements.

The `combinations` method generates all possible combinations of three indices from the array or List of building heights. For example, if the array or List has 5 elements, the method will generate 10 combinations, each consisting of three distinct indices.\n2. The `for` loop iterates over each combination of three indices.\n3. For each combination, the minimum height of the three buildings is calculated using the `min` method. This is the height of the rectangle.\n4. The area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying the height by 3, since the width of each building is 1 unit.\n5. The `max_area` variable is updated to keep track of the maximum area encountered so far.\n6. After the `for` loop, the method returns the maximum area encountered."}

{"category": "function implementation", "language": "Java", "difficulty": "medium", "concepts": "iteration", "instruction": "Write a Java method that takes a sequence of numbers and returns the maximum difference between any two numbers in the sequence. For example, given the sequence [1, 5, 2, 9, 11], the method should return 10 (the difference between 11 and 1).\n\nThe method should handle sequences of any length, including empty sequences, and return None if the sequence contains fewer than two elements.\n\nHere's how you can implement this method:\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(sequence):\n    if len(sequence) < 2:\n        return None\n    else:\n        max_diff = None\n        min_value = sequence[0]\n\n        for value in sequence[1:]:\n            if value < min_value:\n                min_value = value\n            else:\n                diff = value - min_value\n                if max_diff is None or diff > max_diff:\n                    max_diff = diff\n\n        return max_diff\n```\n\nThis method iterates through the sequence, keeping track of the current minimum value. For each value in the sequence, it computes the difference between the current value and the minimum value. If this difference is greater than the current maximum difference, it updates the maximum difference.\n\nAt the end of the iteration, the method returns the maximum difference, or None if the sequence contains fewer than two elements.\n\nThe key concepts in this implementation are:\n\n- Initializing the maximum difference to None allows the method to handle sequences of any length, including empty sequences.\n- Keeping track of the current minimum value allows the method to compute the difference between each value and the minimum value, which is essential for identifying the maximum difference.\n- Using `else` in the `for` loop ensures that the minimum value is updated only when the current value is less than the previous minimum value. This prevents unnecessary updates to the minimum value.\n- Using the ternary operator (`max_diff = diff if diff > max_diff else max_diff`) within the `for` loop allows for efficient update of the maximum difference without the need for an `if-else` statement.\n\nThe solution to this problem involves iterating through the sequence of numbers and keeping track of the current minimum value. For each value in the sequence, the method computes the difference between the current value and the minimum value. If this difference is greater than the current maximum difference, it updates the maximum difference.

For example, given the array or List [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], the maximum number of consecutive occurrences is 5, which is achieved by the number 5.\n\nTo solve this task, you need to iterate through the array or List and count the occurrences of each integer. To optimize the solution, you can use a Map to store the counts of each integer.\n\nHere's how you can write the method in Java:\n\n```python\ndef max_consecutive_occurrences(nums):\n    counts = {}\n    max_count = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1\n        max_count = max(max_count, counts[num])\n\n    return max_count\n```\n\nThe code creates a Map to store the counts of each integer. It initializes the maximum count to zero. Then, it iterates through the array or List of integers. For each integer, it increments its count in the Map using the `.get()` method. If the integer is not in the Map, it is given a default count of 0. The maximum count is updated whenever a new maximum is found. Finally, the maximum count is returned.\n\nNote that the `.get()` method is used to retrieve the count of an integer from the Map. If the integer is not in the Map, it returns a default value of 0, which is added to the count. This ensures that the count of each integer is initialized to 0 when it is first encountered."}
